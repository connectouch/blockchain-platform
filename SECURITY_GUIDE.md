# 🔐 Security Guide - Connectouch Blockchain AI Platform

## 🛡️ Security Overview

This guide outlines the security measures implemented for the Connectouch Blockchain AI Platform deployment.

## 🔑 API Key Management

### ✅ Secure Storage
- **Backend**: API keys stored in Railway environment variables
- **Frontend**: No API keys exposed in client-side code
- **Environment Separation**: Different keys for development/production

### 🔒 API Key Configuration

#### Railway Backend Environment Variables:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-openai-key-here
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=alcht_your-alchemy-key-here
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your-coinmarketcap-key-here
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-256-bits
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key-256-bits
```

#### Security Best Practices:
- ✅ Use strong, randomly generated secrets
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ✅ Monitor API usage for anomalies
- ✅ Set up rate limiting
- ❌ Never commit API keys to version control
- ❌ Never expose API keys in frontend code

## 🌐 Network Security

### CORS Configuration
```javascript
CORS_ORIGIN="https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app,https://main--your-netlify-domain.netlify.app"
```

### HTTPS Enforcement
- ✅ All communications use HTTPS/WSS
- ✅ Secure cookies enabled in production
- ✅ HSTS headers configured

### Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Production rate limits
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000  // 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=200  // 200 requests per window
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Security
- ✅ Strong JWT secrets (256-bit minimum)
- ✅ Short token expiration times
- ✅ Secure token storage
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism

### Session Management
- ✅ Secure session cookies
- ✅ Session timeout
- ✅ Session invalidation on logout

## 🛡️ Frontend Security

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```javascript
// Netlify headers configuration
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

### Input Validation
- ✅ Client-side validation for UX
- ✅ Server-side validation for security
- ✅ Sanitization of user inputs
- ✅ Protection against XSS attacks

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

### Error Tracking
- ✅ Production error handler implemented
- ✅ Error reporting to backend
- ✅ User action tracking for debugging
- ✅ Session-based error correlation

### Security Monitoring
- ✅ Failed authentication attempts
- ✅ Rate limit violations
- ✅ Unusual API usage patterns
- ✅ Error rate monitoring

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Security Incident Checklist
